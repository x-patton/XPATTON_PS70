<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>
Feel free to include sketches, reference images, or links to precedent projects -- whatever helps to explain your idea.

<h4>Idea 1 : Self-Watering Planter Tower</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

A vertical sculptural tower designed to hold multiple small houseplants in an elegant, compact footprint.
Each pot nests into modular holders, creating a stacked, architectural form — functional as greenery but also a centerpiece in the room.
Design language: clean lines and modularity, with the option to mix warm wood tones or translucent cast resin for an organic feel.<br>

<br>Problem it solves:<br>
Many people love having plants at home but forget (or are too busy) to water them regularly, leading to stressed or dead plants. The Planter Tower ensures healthy plant care with minimal effort. A water pump in the base automatically delivers water upward through a concealed tube system to whichever pot needs it. LED indicators on the tower glow subtly when the base reservoir is low.<br>

<br>Materials / Fabrication:<br>
-Sensors: Soil moisture sensors in each pot. Soil data is monitored and only watered when needed — efficient and plant-friendly.<br>
-Pot holders: 3D-printed<br>

<h4>Idea 2: Scented Timekeeper / "Atmos"</h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

A minimalist table or desk lamp that doubles as a scent timekeeper. Light and scent are paired into daily cycles: morning energy, afternoon focus, evening wind-down.<br>
Design language: clean cylindrical or dome housing, translucent resin or frosted acrylic shade, with modular scent pods concealed inside.<br>

<br>Problem it solves:<br>
Diffusers are often fussy — they need constant refilling, and they only serve as background fragrance. The Scented Timekeeper makes scent intentional and structured, marking time of day and supporting rituals without being disruptive. Imagine “time zones” for the day — e.g., citrus + bright white in morning, herbal + neutral light in afternoon, lavender + warm amber at night.<br>

<br>Materials / Fabrication:<br>
-Sensors: Real-time clock module to keep accurate daily cycles; light sensor to adapt to natural room brightness.<br>
-Scent pods: 3D-printed or cast interchangeable cartridges (easy swap, no messy refills).<br>

<h4>Idea 3: Big Bang-Inspired Coffee Table Object / "Atomic Bloom" </h4>
<p class = "margin"></p>

Starts as a compact hub (minimal, MCM-like).<br>
Arms or petals extend outward gradually, with orbs drifting further from the center.<br>
Motion is layered:<br>
-Baseline pulse: arms slowly expanding/retracting, like breathing.<br>
-Unpredictability: random “bursts” where some arms shoot out faster or orbs jitter subtly, evoking cosmic energy.<br>
-Responsive: sunlight or sound input could trigger more dramatic bursts.<br>
<br>
Outputs: LEDs that brighten during “burst” phases, fade during contraction.<br>
Inputs: Light sensor to trigger expansion when sunlight hits, sound sensor for bursts when music plays.<br>
Programming: Randomized intervals so no expansion sequence repeats, keeping it alive and unpredictable.<br>
